# MoveIt! Tutorials

This repository is automatically built by two systems:
* The Travis build output is immediately deployed to gh-pages here: https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/
* The ROS build farm output is hosted here: http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/

The tutorials use the [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html) format commonly used in the Sphinx "Python Documentation Generator". This unfortunately differs from the common Markdown format.

## Travis Continuous Integration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials)

## ROS Buildfarm

[![Build Status](http://build.ros.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Kdoc__moveit_tutorials__ubuntu_xenial_amd64)](http://build.ros.org/job/Kdoc__moveit_tutorials__ubuntu_xenial_amd64/)

## Versions

The ``indigo-devel`` branch should be considered for the most part "frozen" for historical reasons, and new changes to tutorials should be in the ``kinetic-devel`` branch.

## Build

If you want to test the tutorials by generating the html pages locally on your machine, install [rosdoc_lite](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdoc_lite):

    sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosdoc-lite

and run in the root of the package:

    rosdoc_lite -o build .

Then open ``LOCAL_PACKAGE_PATH/build/html/index.html`` in your web browser.

## Deployment

For deploying documentation changes to the web, [Section 3 of rosdoc_lite wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdoc_lite) says that "rosdoc_lite is automatically run for packages in repositories that have rosinstall files listed in the rosdistro repository." This is done about once every 24 hours, [overnight](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdistro/Tutorials/Indexing%20Your%20ROS%20Repository%20for%20Documentation%20Generation).

## Contributing

We rely on the community to keep these tutorials up to date and bug free. If you find an issue with the tutorials please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/issues/new) or open a PR with proposed changes.

### Formatting and Style

* These tutorials use the same [style guidelines](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/code/) as the MoveIt! project. When modifying or adding to these tutorials, it is required that code is auto formatted using [clang-format](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/code/).
* Tutorials should exemplify best coding practices. If a contribution wouldn't pass review in the MoveIt! project, then it shouldn't pass review in the tutorials.
* Each tutorial should be focused on teaching the user one feature or interface within MoveIt!.
* Tutorials should flow from show to tell with videos and demos at the beginning followed by explanations.
* New tutorials should match the formatting, style and flow of existing tutorials whenever possible.
* Relevant code should be included and explained using the ``.. tutorial-formatter::`` tag.
* Irrelevant code should be excluded from the generated html using the ``BEGIN_TUTORIAL``, ``END_TUTORIAL``, ``BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL``, and ``END_SUB_TUTORIAL`` tags.
* Whenever possible, links should be created using the ``extlinks`` dictionary defined in ``conf.py``.
* All demo code should be runnable from within the ``moveit_tutorials`` package.
* Python code should be run using ``rosrun``.

### Directory Structure

* Each tutorial should live in it's own subdirectory within the `./doc/ <>` directory.
* Tutorials should use the following directory structure omitting unnecessary files and subdirectories:
