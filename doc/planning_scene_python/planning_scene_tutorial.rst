Planning Scene Python
==================================

The :moveit_core_python:`core.planning_scene.PlanningScene` class provides the main interface that you will use
for collision checking and constraint checking. In this tutorial, we
will explore the Python interface to this class.

Getting Started
---------------
If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed the steps in `Getting Started <../getting_started/getting_started.html>`_.

The entire code
---------------
The entire code can be seen :codedir:`here in the MoveIt GitHub project<planning_scene>`.

.. tutorial-formatter:: ./src/planning_scene_tutorial.py

Running the code
----------------
If you haven't already, you need to clone `panda_moveit_config <http://github.com/ros-planning/panda_moveit_config>`_ in your catkin workspace and build. Then, open two shells and start RViz and wait for everything to finish loading in the first shell:  ::

  roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch

Run the code directly from moveit_tutorials: ::

 rosrun moveit_tutorials planning_scene_tutorial.py

Expected Output
---------------

The output should look something like this, though we are using random
joint values so some things may be different. ::

**Note:** Don't worry if your output has different ROS console format. You can customize your ROS console logger by following `this blog post <http://dav.ee/blog/notes/archives/898>`_.
