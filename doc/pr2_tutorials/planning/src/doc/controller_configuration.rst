Controllers Configuration Tutorial
===================================

In this section, we will walk through configuring MoveIt! with the controllers on your robot. We will assume that your robot offers a ``FollowJointTrajectory`` action service for the arms on your robot and (optionally) a ``GripperCommand`` service for your gripper.

YAML Configuration
------------------

The first file to create is a YAML configuration file (call it *controllers.yaml* and place it in the *config* directory of your MoveIt! config directory). This will specify the controller configuration for your robot. Here's an example file for configuring a ``FollowJointTrajectory`` action controller for two different arms (left and right) and a ``GripperCommand`` gripper controller for two grippers ::

 controller_list:
  - name: r_arm_controller
    action_ns: follow_joint_trajectory
    type: FollowJointTrajectory
    default: true
    joints:
      - r_shoulder_pan_joint
      - r_shoulder_lift_joint
      - r_upper_arm_roll_joint
      - r_elbow_flex_joint
      - r_forearm_roll_joint
      - r_wrist_flex_joint
      - r_wrist_roll_joint
  - name: l_arm_controller
    action_ns: follow_joint_trajectory
    type: FollowJointTrajectory
    default: true
    joints:
      - l_shoulder_pan_joint
      - l_shoulder_lift_joint
      - l_upper_arm_roll_joint
      - l_elbow_flex_joint
      - l_forearm_roll_joint
      - l_wrist_flex_joint
      - l_wrist_roll_joint
  - name: gripper_controller
    action_ns: gripper_action
    type: GripperCommand
    default: true
    joints:
      - l_gripper_joint
      - r_gripper_joint

We will walk through the parameters for both types of controllers.

FollowJointTrajectory Controller Interface
------------------------------------------
The parameters are:
 * *name*: The name of the controller.  (See debugging information below for important notes).
 * *action_ns*: The action namespace for the controller. (See debugging information below for important notes).
 * *type*: The type of action being used (here FollowJointTrajectory).
 * *default*: The default controller is the primary controller chosen by MoveIt! for communicating with a particular set of joints.
 * *joints*: Names of all the joints that are being addressed by this interface.

GripperCommand Controller Interface
-----------------------------------
The parameters are:
 * *name*: The name of the controller.  (See debugging information below for important notes).
 * *action_ns*: The action namespace for the controller. (See debugging information below for important notes).
 * *type*: The type of action being used (here GripperCommand).
 * *default*: The default controller is the primary controller chosen by MoveIt! for communicating with a particular set of joints.
 * *joints*: Names of all the joints that are being addressed by this interface.


Create the Controller launch file
---------------------------------

Now, create the controller launch file (call it *robot_moveit_controller_manager.launch* where *robot* is the name of your robot - the robot name needs to match the name specified when you created your MoveIt! config directory).

Add the following lines to this file ::

 <launch>
  <!-- Set the param that trajectory_execution_manager needs to find the controller plugin -->
  <arg name="moveit_controller_manager" default="moveit_simple_controller_manager/MoveItSimpleControllerManager" />
  <param name="moveit_controller_manager" value="$(arg moveit_controller_manager)"/>
  <!-- load controller_list -->
  <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_name_moveit_config)/config/controllers.yaml"/>
 </launch>

MAKE SURE to replace *my_robot_name_moveit_config* with the correct path for your MoveIt! config directory.

Now, you should be ready to have MoveIt! talk to your robot.

Debugging Information
---------------------
The ``FollowJointTrajectory`` or ``GripperCommand`` interfaces on your robot must be communicating in the namespace: ``\name\action_ns``. In the above example, you should be able to see the following topics (using *rostopic list*) on your robot:

 * /r_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
 * /r_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/feedback
 * /r_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/result
 * /l_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/goal
 * /l_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/feedback
 * /l_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/result
 * /gripper_controller/gripper_action/goal
 * /gripper_controller/gripper_action/feedback
 * /gripper_controller/gripper_action/result

You should also be able to see (using *rostopic info topic_name*) that the topics are published/subscribed to by the controllers on your robot and also by the *move_group* node.

Remapping /joint_states topic
-----------------------------

When you run a `move group node <http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/pr2_tutorials/planning/src/doc/move_group_interface_tutorial.html>`_, you may need to remap the topic /joint_states to /robot/joint_states, otherwise MoveIt! won't have feedback from the joints. To do this remapping you could make a simple launch file for your node as follows ::

  <node pkg="moveit_ros_move_group" type="move_group" name="any_name" output="screen">
    <remap from="joint_states" to="robot/joint_states"/>
  </node>

Or you can make a subscriber with the correct topic name and then ensure that the starting robot state for your move group corresponds to a correct joints angle by using the call back of this subscriber.
