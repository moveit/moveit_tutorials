## BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL imports
##
## To use the python interface to move_group, import the moveit_commander
## module.  We also import rospy and some messages that we will use.

def move_group_python_interface_tutorial():
  ## BEGIN_TUTORIAL
  ##
  ## Setup
  ## ^^^^^
  ## CALL_SUB_TUTORIAL imports
  ##
  ## First initialize moveit_commander and rospy.
  print "============ Starting tutorial setup"
  moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
  rospy.init_node('move_group_python_interface_tutorial',
                  anonymous=True)

  ## Instantiate a RobotCommander object.  This object is an interface to
  ## the robot as a whole.
  robot = moveit_commander.RobotCommander()

  ## Instantiate a PlanningSceneInterface object.  This object is an interface
  ## to the world surrounding the robot.
  scene = moveit_commander.PlanningSceneInterface()

  ## Instantiate a MoveGroupCommander object.  This object is an interface
  ## to one group of joints.  In this case the group is the joints in the left
  ## arm.  This interface can be used to plan and execute motions on the left
  ## arm.
  group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander("left_arm")


  ## We create this DisplayTrajectory publisher which is used below to publish
  ## trajectories for RVIZ to visualize.
  display_trajectory_publisher = rospy.Publisher(
                                      '/move_group/display_planned_path',
                                      moveit_msgs.msg.DisplayTrajectory,
                                      queue_size=20)

  ## Wait for RVIZ to initialize. This sleep is ONLY to allow Rviz to come up.
  print "============ Waiting for RVIZ..."
  rospy.sleep(10)
  print "============ Starting tutorial "

  ## Getting Basic Information
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ##
  ## We can get the name of the reference frame for this robot
  print "============ Reference frame: %s" % group.get_planning_frame()

  ## We can also print the name of the end-effector link for this group
  print "============ Reference frame: %s" % group.get_end_effector_link()

  ## We can get a list of all the groups in the robot
  print "============ Robot Groups:"
  print robot.get_group_names()

  ## Sometimes for debugging it is useful to print the entire state of the
  ## robot.
  print "============ Printing robot state"
  print robot.get_current_state()
  print "============"


  ## Planning to a Pose goal
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ## We can plan a motion for this group to a desired pose for the 
  ## end-effector
  print "============ Generating plan 1"
  pose_target = geometry_msgs.msg.Pose()
  pose_target.orientation.w = 1.0
  pose_target.position.x = 0.7
  pose_target.position.y = -0.05
  pose_target.position.z = 1.1
  group.set_pose_target(pose_target)

  ## Now, we call the planner to compute the plan
  ## and visualize it if successful
  ## Note that we are just planning, not asking move_group 
  ## to actually move the robot
  plan1 = group.plan()
  

  print "============ Waiting while RVIZ displays plan1..."
  rospy.sleep(5)

 
  ## You can ask RVIZ to visualize a plan (aka trajectory) for you.  But the
  ## group.plan() method does this automatically so this is not that useful
  ## here (it just displays the same trajectory again).
  print "============ Visualizing plan1"
  display_trajectory = moveit_msgs.msg.DisplayTrajectory()

  display_trajectory.trajectory_start = robot.get_current_state()
  display_trajectory.trajectory.append(plan1)
  display_trajectory_publisher.publish(display_trajectory);

  print "============ Waiting while plan1 is visualized (again)..."
  rospy.sleep(5)


  ## Moving to a pose goal
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ##
  ## Moving to a pose goal is similar to the step above
  ## except we now use the go() function. Note that
  ## the pose goal we had set earlier is still active 
  ## and so the robot will try to move to that goal. We will
  ## not use that function in this tutorial since it is 
  ## a blocking function and requires a controller to be active
  ## and report success on execution of a trajectory.

  # Uncomment below line when working with a real robot
  # group.go(wait=True)
  
  # Use execute instead if you would like the robot to follow 
  # the plan that has already been computed
  # group.execute(plan1)

  ## Planning to a joint-space goal 
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ##
  ## Let's set a joint space goal and move towards it. 
  ## First, we will clear the pose target we had just set.

  group.clear_pose_targets()

  ## Then, we will get the current set of joint values for the group
  group_variable_values = group.get_current_joint_values()
  print "============ Joint values: ", group_variable_values

  ## Now, let's modify one of the joints, plan to the new joint
  ## space goal and visualize the plan
  group_variable_values[0] = 1.0
  group.set_joint_value_target(group_variable_values)

  plan2 = group.plan()

  print "============ Waiting while RVIZ displays plan2..."
  rospy.sleep(5)


  ## Cartesian Paths
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ## You can plan a cartesian path directly by specifying a list of waypoints 
  ## for the end-effector to go through.
  waypoints = []

  # start with the current pose
  waypoints.append(group.get_current_pose().pose)

  # first orient gripper and move forward (+x)
  wpose = geometry_msgs.msg.Pose()
  wpose.orientation.w = 1.0
  wpose.position.x = waypoints[0].position.x + 0.1
  wpose.position.y = waypoints[0].position.y
  wpose.position.z = waypoints[0].position.z
  waypoints.append(copy.deepcopy(wpose))

  # second move down
  wpose.position.z -= 0.10
  waypoints.append(copy.deepcopy(wpose))

  # third move to the side
  wpose.position.y += 0.05
  waypoints.append(copy.deepcopy(wpose))

  ## We want the cartesian path to be interpolated at a resolution of 1 cm
  ## which is why we will specify 0.01 as the eef_step in cartesian
  ## translation.  We will specify the jump threshold as 0.0, effectively
  ## disabling it.
  (plan3, fraction) = group.compute_cartesian_path(
                               waypoints,   # waypoints to follow
                               0.01,        # eef_step
                               0.0)         # jump_threshold
                               
  print "============ Waiting while RVIZ displays plan3..."
  rospy.sleep(5)

  # Uncomment the line below to execute this plan on a real robot.
  # group.execute(plan3)
  
  
  ## Adding/Removing Objects and Attaching/Detaching Objects
  ## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ## First, we will define the collision object message
  collision_object = moveit_msgs.msg.CollisionObject()



  ## When finished shut down moveit_commander.
  moveit_commander.roscpp_shutdown()

  ## END_TUTORIAL
