Overview
----------------------
The MoveIt! Setup Assistant is a graphical user interface for
configuring any robot for use with MoveIt!. Its primary function is
generating a Semantic Robot Description Format (SRDF) file for your
robot. Additionally, it generates other necessary configuration files
for use with the MoveIt! pipeline. To learn more about the SRDF, you
can go through the `URDF/SRDF Overview <../urdf_srdf/urdf_srdf_tutorial.html>`_
page.

Getting Started
------------------------

MoveIt! and ROS

* Follow the instructions for :moveit_website:`installing MoveIt!<install>`
  first if you have not already done that.

* If you haven't already done so, make sure you have the `Franka description
  package <https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros>`_ for Melodic: ::

    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-franka-description

.. note:: Oct 23, 2018: franka_description is [not fully available for ROS Melodic](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/issues/34).

Until then please manually clone the franka description package: ::

  git clone https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros

* If you have the ``panda_moveit_config`` package already git-cloned from the *Getting Started* page, be sure to delete that now since this tutorial will teach you how to create it from scratch: ::

   cd ~/ws_moveit/src
   rm -rf panda_moveit_config
   catkin clean panda_moveit_config

Step 1: Start
---------------

* To start the MoveIt! Setup Assistant: ::

   roslaunch moveit_setup_assistant setup_assistant.launch

* This will bring up the start screen with two choices: *Create New
  MoveIt! Configuration Package* or *Edit Existing MoveIt!
  Configuration Package*.

* Click on the *Create New MoveIt! Configuration Package* button to
  bring up the following screen:

.. image:: setup_assistant_start.png

* Click on the browse button and navigate to the *panda_arm_hand.urdf.xacro* file
  installed when you installed the Franka package above. (This file
  gets installed in
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/franka_description/robots/panda_arm_hand.urdf.xacro on Ubuntu
  with ROS Melodic.)  Choose that file and then click *Load Files*. The
  Setup Assistant will load the files (this might take a few seconds)
  and present you with this screen:

   :width: 700px

Step 2: Generate Self-Collision Matrix
--------------------------------------

The Default Self-Collision Matrix Generator searches for pairs of
links on the robot that can safely be disabled from collision
checking, decreasing motion planning processing time. These pairs of
links are disabled when they are always in collision, never in
collision, in collision in the robot's default position or when the
links are adjacent to each other on the kinematic chain. The sampling
density specifies how many random robot positions to check for self
collision. Higher densities require more computation time while lower
densities have a higher possibility of disabling pairs that should not
be disabled. The default value is 10,000 collision checks. Collision
checking is done in parallel to decrease processing time.

* Click on the *Self-Collisions* pane selector on the left-hand side
  and click on the *Generate Collision Matrix* button. The
  Setup Assistant will work for a few second before presenting you the
  results of its computation in the main table.

Step 3: Add Virtual Joints
--------------------------

Virtual joints are used primarily to attach the robot to the
world. For the Panda we will define only one virtual joint attaching the
*panda_link0* of the Panda to the *world* world
frame. This virtual joint represents the motion of the base of the
robot in a plane.

* Click on the *Virtual Joints* pane selector. Click on *Add Virtual Joint*

* Set the joint name as "virtual_joint"

* Set the child link as "panda_link0" and the parent frame name as "world".

* Set the Joint Type as "fixed".

* Click *Save* and you should see this screen:

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_virtual_joints.png
   :width: 700px

Step 4: Add Planning Groups
---------------------------

Planning groups are used for semantically describing different parts
of your robot, such as defining what an arm is, or an end effector.

* Click on the *Planning Groups* pane selector.

* Click on *Add Group* and you should see the following screen:

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_planning_groups.png
   :width: 700px

Add the arm

* We will first add Panda arm as a planning group

  * Enter *Group Name* as **panda_arm**

  * Choose *kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin* as the
    kinematics solver. *Note: if you have a custom robot and would
    like a powerful custom IK solver, see* `Kinematics/IKFast <../ikfast/ikfast_tutorial.html>`_

  * Let *Kin. Search Resolution* and *Kin. Search Timeout* stay at
    their default values.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_arm.png
   :width: 700px

* Now, click on the *Add Joints* button. You will see a
  list of joints on the left hand side. You need to choose all the
  joints that belong to the arm and add them to the right hand
  side. The joints are arranged in the order that they are stored in
  an internal tree structure. This makes it easy to select a serial
  chain of joints.

  * Click on **virtual_joint**, hold down the **Shift**
    button on your keyboard and then click on the
    *panda_joint8*. Now click on the **>** button to add these
    joints into the list of selected joints on the right.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_arm_joints.png
   :width: 700px

* Click *Save* to save the selected group.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_arm_joints_saved.png
   :width: 700px

Add the gripper

* We will also add a group for the end
  effector. NOTE that you will do this using a different procedure
  than adding the arm.

  * Click on the *Add Group* button.

  * Enter *Group Name* as **hand**

  * Let *Kin. Search Resolution* and *Kin. Search Timeout* stay at their default values.

  * Click on the *Add Links* button.

  * Choose **panda_hand**, **panda_leftfinger**, and **panda_rightfinger** and add them
    to the list of *Selected Links* on the right hand side.

  * Click *Save*

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_planning_groups_gripper.png
   :width: 700px

Step 5: Add Robot Poses
-----------------------

The Setup Assistant allows you to add certain fixed poses into the
configuration. This helps if, for example, you want to define a
certain position of the robot as a **Home** position.

* Click on the *Robot Poses* pane.

* Click *Add Pose*. Choose a name for the pose. The robot will be in
  its *Default* position where the joint values are set to the
  mid-range of the allowed joint value range. Move the individual
  joints around until you are happy and then *Save* the pose. Note
  how poses are associated with particular groups. You can save
  individual poses for each group.

* **IMPORTANT TIP**: Try to move all the joints around. If there is
  something wrong with the joint limits in your URDF, you should be able
  to see it immediately here.

   :width: 700px

Step 6: Label End Effectors
---------------------------

We have already added the gripper of the Panda. Now, we
will designate this group as a special group:
**end effectors**. Designating this group as end effectors allows
some special operations to happen on them internally.

* Click on the *End Effectors* pane.

* Click *Add End Effector*.

* Choose **hand** as the *End Effector Name* for the gripper.

* Select **hand** as the *End Effector Group*.

* Select **panda_link8** as the *Parent Link* for this end-effector.

* Leave *Parent Group* blank.

Step 7: Add Passive Joints
--------------------------

The passive joints tab is meant to allow specification of any passive
joints that might exist in a robot. These are joints that are unactuated
on a robot (e.g. passive casters.) This tells the planners that they
cannot (kinematically) plan for these joints because they can't be
directly controlled. The Panda does not have any passive
joints so we will skip this step.


Step 8: 3D Perception
--------------------------

The 3D Perception tab is meant to set the parameters of the YAML configuration file
for configuring the 3D sensors `sensors_3d.yaml`.

e.g. `point_cloud` parameters:

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_3d_perception_point_cloud.png
   :width: 700px

For more details about those parameters please see perception pipeline `tutorial <../perception_pipeline/perception_pipeline_tutorial.html>`_

In case of `sensors_3d.yaml` was not needed, choose `None`.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_3d_perception.png

Step 9: Gazebo Simulation
--------------------------

The Simulation tab can be used to help you simulate your robot with Gazebo by generating a new Gazebo compatible urdf if needed.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_simulation_screen.png
   :width: 700px

You can use the generated robot `urdf` to spawn the robot in Gazebo in the following way.

* Use rosrun to start gazebo empty world: ::

   roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch paused:=true use_sim_time:=false gui:=true throttled:=false recording:=false debug:=true

* Use rosrun to spawn the robot: ::

   rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file </path_to_new_urdf/file_name.urdf> -urdf -x 0 -y 0 -z 1 -model panda

Step 10: ROS Control
---------------------

ROS Control is a set of packages that include controller interfaces, controller managers, transmissions and hardware_interfaces, for more details please look at `ros_control` documentation_

.. _documentation: http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control

ROS Control tab can be used to auto generate simulated controllers to actuate the joints of your robot. This will allow us to provide the correct ROS interfaces MoveIt!.

* Click on the *ROS Control* pane selector.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_ros_control.png
   :width: 700px

* Click on *Add Controller* and you should see the following screen:

* We will first add Panda arm position controller

* Enter *Controller Name* as **arm_position_controller**

* Choose **position_controllers/JointPositionController** as the controller type

* Next you have to choose this controller joints, you can add joints individually or add all the joints in a planning group all together.

* Now, click on Add Planning Group Joints.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_ros_control_create.png
   :width: 700px

* Choose panda_arm planning group to add all the joints in that group to the arm controller.

.. image:: setup_assistant_panda_ros_control_add_joints.png
   :width: 700px

* Click *Save* to save the selected controller.

Step 11: Add Author Information
--------------------------------

Catkin requires author information for publishing purposes

* Click on the *Author Information* pane.
* Enter your name and email address.


Step 12: Generate Configuration Files
--------------------------------------

You are almost there. One last step - generating all the configuration
files that you will need to start using MoveIt!

* Click on the *Configuration Files* pane. Choose a location and
  name for the ROS package that will be generated containing your new
  set of configuration files. Click browse, select a good
  location (for example, your home directory), click **Create New Folder**, call it
  "panda_moveit_config", and click **Choose**.
  "panda_moveit_config" is the location used in the rest of the
  documentation on this wiki. This package does not have to be within your
  ROS package path. All generated files will go directly into the
  directory you have chosen.

* Click on the *Generate Package* button. The Setup Assistant will
  now generate and write a set of launch and config files into the
  directory of your choosing. All the generated files will appear in the
  Generated Files/Folders tab and you can click on each of them for a
  description of what they contain.

* Congratulations!! - You are now done generating the configuration
  files you need for MoveIt!
