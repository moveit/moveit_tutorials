Gazebo Simulation Integration
=============================

`Gazebo <http://gazebosim.org/>`_ is the most popular robotics simulator in the ROS ecosystem, so is naturally a good fit to integrate with MoveIt.

The `MoveIt Setup Assistant <../setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html>`_ helps setup your robot to work with Gazebo, but there are still additional steps required to successfully run MoveIt in Gazebo.

We need someone to convert this into a full tutorial. For inspiration, see the Medium article `Custom Manipulator Simulation in Gazebo and Motion Planning with MoveIt <https://medium.com/@tahsincankose/custom-manipulator-simulation-in-gazebo-and-motion-planning-with-moveit-c017eef1ea90>`_.
