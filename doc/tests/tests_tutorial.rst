Integration/Unit Tests
======================

How to test changes to MoveIt! on various robots, including unit and integration tests.

**Note:** *This is a stub tutorial, to be expanded upon in the future*

Getting Started
---------------
If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed the steps in `Getting Started <../getting_started/getting_started.html>`_.

Integration Test
----------------

A Python-based integration test is available for testing higher-level move_group functionality in MoveIt! - to run: ::

 rostest moveit_ros_planning_interface python_move_group.test

Test Robots
-----------

**Panda**

From the package `panda_moveit_config <https://github.com/ros-planning/panda_moveit_config>`_: ::

  roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch

**Fanuc M-10iA**

From the package `moveit_resources <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_resources>`_: ::

  roslaunch moveit_resources demo.launch

Unit Tests
----------

Writing Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire test file, with includes, can be seen :codedir:`here <tests>` in the moveit_tutorials GitHub project.

MoveIt! uses Google Test as a testing framework.

.. tutorial-formatter:: ./src/tests.cpp


Running Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run unit tests locally on the entire MoveIt! catkin workspace using catkin-tools: ::

  catkin run_tests -iv

To run a test for just 1 package::

  catkin run_tests --no-deps --this -iv

To ignore most of the log/print output of the tests::

  catkin run_tests --no-status --summarize --no-deps --this


Code Coverage
-------------

Test coverage measures the lines of code that are executed while running the test suite.
To accumulate statistics and create a html coverage report, build the code without optimization
and run the special `_coverage` target::

  sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-code-coverage
  catkin config --cmake-args -DENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  catkin build
  catkin build moveit_core -v --no-deps --catkin-make-args moveit_core_coverage

The output will print where the coverage report is located and it looks similar to the following image:
