MoveIt! RViz Plugin Tutorial
=============================

MoveIt! comes with a plugin for the ROS Visualizer (RViz). The plugin
allows you to setup scenes in which the robot will work, generate
plans, visualize the output and interact directly with a visualized
robot. We will explore the plugin in this tutorial.

Pre-requisites
---------------

To use the Rviz plugin, a ``ROBOT_moveit_config`` package must exist containing all the necessary
configurations to use MoveIt!. If you are using a standard robot, it is highly likely a MoveIt!
config package already exists, e.g. the PR2, Baxter, UR5, etc. The recommended robot to run these
tutorials is currently the Panda. If you want to try these tutorials with your own
custom robot see the  `MoveIt! Setup Assistant tutorial
<../setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html>`_, otherwise follow these next steps:

**Use Default Panda MoveIt! Configuration**

Note: This tutorial does **not** require you to actually have a Panda robot, it just needs a set of
working robot model files.

If you don't yet have a catkin workspace for this tutorial, create one now::

  mkdir -p ~/ws_moveit/src
  cd ~/ws_moveit/src

Build and source the moveit_config package::

  git clone https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/panda_moveit_config.git
  rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic
  cd ..
  catkin config --extend /opt/ros/kinetic --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  catkin build
  . ~/ws_moveit/devel/setup.bash

*(NOTE: If you prefer the older catkin_make tool, simply replace 'catkin build' with 'catkin_make')*

Step 1: Launch the demo and Configure the Plugin
------------------------------------------------

* Launch the demo::

   roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch

* If you are doing this for the first time, you will have to add the Motion Planning Plugin.

  * In the Rviz Displays Tab, press *Add*

  * From the moveit_ros_visualization folder, choose "MotionPlanning" as the DisplayType. Press "Ok".

* In the "Global Options" tab of the "Displays" subwindow, set the **Fixed Frame** field to "/odom_combined"

* Now, you can start configuring the Plugin for your robot (the Panda in
  this case).  Click on "MotionPlanning" within "Displays".

  * Make sure the **Robot Description** field is set to "robot_description"

  * Make sure the **Planning Scene Topic** field is set to "planning_scene".

  * In **Planning Request**, change the **Planning Group** to "arm".

  * Set the **Trajectory Topic** in the Planned Path tab to "/move_group/display_planned_path".

Step 2: Play with the visualized robots
---------------------------------------
There are four different visualizations active here currently:

#. The start state for motion planning (the planned group is represented in green).

#. The goal state for motion planning (the planned group is represented in orange).

#. The robot's configuration in the planning scene/ planning environment

#. The planned path for the robot,

The display states for each of these visualizations can be toggled on and off using checkboxes.

#. The start state using the "Query Start State" checkbox in the "Planning Request" tab.

#. The goal state using the "Query Goal State" checkbox in the "Planning Request" tab.

#. The planning scene robot using the "Show Robot Visual" checkbox in the "Scene Robot" tab.

#. The planned path using the "Show Robot Visual" checkbox in the "Planned Path" tab.

* Play with all these checkboxes to switch on and off different visualizations.

Step 3: Interact with the Panda
-----------------------------

* Press **Interact** in the top menu of rviz (Note: some tools may be
  hidden, press **+** in the top menu to add the **Interact** tool as shown below).
  You should see a couple of interactive markers appear for the
  arm of the Panda.

    * One marker (corresponding to the orange colored right arm) will
      be used to set the "Goal State" for motion planning. Another
      marker corresponding to a green colored representation of the
      right arm will be used to set the "Start State" for motion
      planning.

    * You will be able to use these markers (which are attached to the
      tip link of each arm) to drag the arm around and change its
      orientation.

Moving into collision
+++++++++++++++++++++

Note what happens when you try to move one of the arms into collision
with the other. The two links that are in collision will turn red.

The "Use Collision-Aware IK" checkbox found within the MotionPlanning
plugin allows you to toggle the behavior of the IK solver. When the
checkbox is ticked, the solver will keep attempting to find a
collision-free solution for the desired end-effector pose. When it is
unticked, the solver will allow collisions to happen in the solution.
The links in collision will always still be visualized in red,
regardless of the state of the checkbox.

Moving out of reachable workspace
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Note also what happens when you try to move an end-effector out of its
reachable workspace.

Step 4: Use Motion Planning with the Panda
----------------------------------------

* Now, you can start motion planning with the Panda in the MoveIt! Rviz Plugin.

  * Move the Start State to a desired location.

  * Move the Goal State to another desired location.

  * Make sure both states are not in collision with the robot itself.

  * Make sure the Planned Path is being visualized. Also check the
    "Show Trail" checkbox in the Planned Path tab.

* In the Planning tab (at the bottom), press the Plan button. You
  should be able to see a visualization of the arm moving and a trail.

Introspecting trajectory waypoints
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*Available since: Indigo 0.7.10, Kinetic and Lunar 0.9.7*

You can visually introspect trajectory point by point on RViz.

* From "`Panel`" menu, enable "`MotionPlanning - Slider`" that is disabled by default. You'll see a new Slider panel on RViz.

* Set your goal pose, then run `Plan`.

* Play with the "`Slider`" panel, e.g. move the slider, push "`Play`" button.

NOTE: Once you placed your EEF to a new goal, be sure to run `Plan` before running `Play` -- otherwise you'll see the waypoints for the previous goal if available.
