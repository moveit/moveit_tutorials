Planning Scene Tutorial
==================================

The :planning_scene:`PlanningScene` class provides the main interface that you will use
for collision checking and constraint checking. In this tutorial, we
will explore the C++ interface to this class.

.. tutorial-formatter:: ../planning_scene_tutorial.cpp

The entire code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The entire code can be seen :codedir:`here in the MoveIt! Github project<planning>`.

Compiling the code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow the `instructions for compiling code from source <http://moveit.ros.org/install/>`_.

The launch file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The entire launch file is `here <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_tutorials/tree/kinetic-devel/doc/pr2_tutorials/planning/launch/planning_scene_tutorial.launch>`_ on github. All the code in this
tutorial can be compiled and run from the moveit_tutorials package
that you have as part of your MoveIt! setup.

Running the code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roslaunch the launch file to run the code directly from moveit_tutorials::

 roslaunch moveit_tutorials planning_scene_tutorial.launch

Expected Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output should look something like this, though we are using random
joint values so some things may be different::
